# CIS 4300 Course Alert Redesign – Stage 4

This repository contains the static   HTML/CSS implementation   of the   Course Alert   redesign for Path@Penn.

## Files Included
- `index.html` → main course page structure
- `style.css` → styling for layout, colors, and buttons
- `README.md` → instructions and description

## Running Instructions
1. Download and unzip the folder.
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser (Chrome, Safari, Edge, etc.).
3. The page will display the CIS 4300 course information with the new   “Subscribe to Course Alert”   button integrated.

The goal is to show how students could easily   subscribe to seat availability notifications   directly within Path@Penn, improving the registration experience.
