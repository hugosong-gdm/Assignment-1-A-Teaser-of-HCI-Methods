# CIS 4300 Course Alert Redesign – Stage 4

This repository contains the static   HTML/CSS implementation   of the   Course Alert   redesign for Path@Penn.

## Files Included
- `index.html` → main course page structure
- `style.css` → styling for layout, colors, and buttons
- `README.md` → instructions and description

## Running Instructions
1. Download and unzip the folder.
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser (Chrome, Safari, Edge, etc.).
3. The page will display the CIS 4300 course information with the new   “Subscribe to Course Alert”   button integrated.

No backend or extra setup is required. This is a static prototype for demonstration only.

## Description
This implementation represents   Stage 4   of Assignment 1:
-   Stage 1  : Identified four ideas for redesign (Penn Course Review, Course Alert, Expandable Sections, Top Permission Warning).
-   Stage 2  : Created low-fidelity sketches for each idea.
-   Stage 3  : Developed high-fidelity mockups and conducted peer evaluation.
-   Stage 4  : Implemented the   Course Alert feature   as a static HTML/CSS page.

The goal is to show how students could easily   subscribe to seat availability notifications   directly within Path@Penn, reducing stress and improving the registration experience.
